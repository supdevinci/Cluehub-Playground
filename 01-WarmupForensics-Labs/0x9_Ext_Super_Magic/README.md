We salvaged a ruined Ext SuperMagic II-class mech recently and pulled the filesystem out of the black box. It looks a bit corrupted, but maybe there's something interesting in there.

## Hints
- Are there any tools for diagnosing corrupted filesystems? What do they say if you run them on this one?
- You might find this [doc](http://www.nongnu.org/ext2-doc/ext2.html) helpful.
